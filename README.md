## IDEA Markdown Navigator License Builder

> **DO NOT** use it for any business work. Disregard this order at your peril.

This project is based on [**multimarkdown**](https://github.com/hutu92/multimarkdown), which is mainly used to rebuild license with Java.

As for how to build? Just compile src folder, and generate `LicenseAgent.class`, which should be replaced at the corresponding folder in `idea-multimarkdown.jar`.
